We present an adaptive method, based on color-KL sparse estimation, to reconstruct videos from pixels sampled at extremely low rates (for example 1% of all pixels), and sampled at random locations. **A**daptive **D**epth **E**fficient **F**iltering by **A**daptive **N**ormalization (ADEFAN) is thus aimed at extreme video completion from random pixels. It is also an extremely efficient compression method in terms of pre-processing, while outperforming even MPEG compression at extremely high compression rates. It also provides indirect encryption because a key must be shared to identify the locations of the randomly-sampled pixels.
